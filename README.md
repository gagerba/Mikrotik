# Mikrotik

Very simplistic examples of switch configuration for Mikrotik CRS112 and CRS328 VLANs, this is for RouterOS 6, so probably outdated now if you run on RouterOS 7. I am not a fond of Mikrotik syntax for configuring switching. 🤦🏻‍♂️

Added an example of a CCR2004 configuration with BGP and the awful filters used by RouterOS version 7. 🫡
